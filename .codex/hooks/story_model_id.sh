# STORY SessionStart hook (Codex CLI) — inject the runtime-reported model id into
# session context so skills record a real model_id instead of "unrecorded".
#
# Codex puts a `model` field (active model slug) on the SessionStart payload and
# accepts the same output shape as Claude Code: hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext.
# That field describes the moment the session opened; /model changes the model
# afterwards with no hook firing, so a session can write with one model while
# still holding the name of another.
#
# Codex also keeps a rollout file per session and stamps a `turn_context` record
# with the model of each turn. Where the payload names that file in
# `transcript_path`, the injected line hands the skill a command that reads it at
# the moment the value is recorded, which is the moment it is true. Where it does
# not, the session-start field is all there is, and is injected as before. When
# `model` is absent too, the honest value per workflow provenance rule is
# "unrecorded". Registered under [hooks.SessionStart] in .codex/hooks.json.

# --resolve <transcript_path> [session_model]: print the model of the last turn
# recorded in a rollout, or nothing at all. Run on demand by skills, per the line
# injected below. Prints nothing rather than failing, so "unrecorded" stays the
# fallback.
#
# session_model is what SessionStart reported. It stands in when the rollout
# names nothing yet, and is preferred over an identical id so that a suffix the
# rollout drops survives. It never wins over a different id — that difference is
# a mid-session switch, and the rollout is the one that saw it.
