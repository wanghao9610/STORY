# STORY PermissionRequest hook (Codex CLI) — skip the approval prompt for a file
# edit while the project runs at INVOLVE=low (.env, writing workflow conventions
# §7). Confirmation points are untouched: the STOP line, deletions and
# overwrites, and every institutional-requirement value entering as confirmed are questions a
# skill asks, not prompts a hook can answer.
#
# Codex's counterpart to Claude's PreToolUse gate, written to Codex's own shapes.
# PermissionRequest is the event that fires just before the CLI waits on the
# user, and it is the one that takes decision.behavior; PreToolUse also documents
# an allow, but a released codex-cli rejected it, so approval goes through the
# event built for it. Registered under [hooks.PermissionRequest] in
# .codex/hooks.json, matching apply_patch. Codex offers no project-directory
# variable and runs hooks with the session cwd as their working directory, which
# is the project root a skill also runs in.
#
# Silence means "no decision", so every other level, every patch this declines,
# and a project with no .env fall through to the normal approval prompt.
