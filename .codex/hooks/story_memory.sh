# STORY SessionStart hook (Codex CLI) — inject the project's memory index into
# session context so a session starts knowing what earlier sessions in this
# repository learned.
#
# The store is .story/memory/ in the project, not the harness's own memory: one
# file per fact, with a git-ignored local/ beside it (like .env) holding what
# stays on this machine: the machine: scoped facts, and any memory the author
# keeps off the repository. What is injected is an index built here from each
# file's frontmatter — type, scope, verified, summary — one line per memory,
# newest first: the lines are pointers, and the fact itself is read from its
# file when it matters. What belongs in the store, and the file format, is
# docs/mds/story-workflow/writing-workflow-conventions.md section 10.
#
# `--list` prints that index as plain text and reads no payload: the form a
# person, a test, or the consistency check calls by hand.
#
# Nothing is printed when the store holds no entries, so a fresh thesis pays
# nothing: the rule that creates the first memory is AGENTS.md section 8, which
# is loaded anyway.
#
# Registered under [hooks.SessionStart] in .codex/hooks.json, in a group of its
# own with no matcher: a session that starts over (after /clear, say) has lost
# the index as surely as a new one, while model_id stays on startup|resume.
# Codex accepts the same output shape as Claude Code:
# hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext.

Each line is a pointer, not the fact: type · scope · last verified · file — summary. Open the file under .story/memory/ before acting on one. A scope naming a machine or a milestone applies only there, and where a memory disagrees with a file in the repository, the file wins. A memory is never a source for a number, an institutional rule, or what a cited paper says — those trace to mates/, degree/ and miles/, and notes/refs/.
