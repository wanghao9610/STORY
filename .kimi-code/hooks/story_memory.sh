# STORY UserPromptSubmit hook (Kimi Code) — inject the project's memory index
# into context once per session, so a session starts knowing what earlier
# sessions in this repository learned.
#
# The store is .story/memory/ in the project, not the harness's own memory: one
# file per fact, with a git-ignored local/ beside it (like .env) holding what
# stays on this machine: the machine: scoped facts, and any memory the author
# keeps off the repository. What is injected is an index built here from each
# file's frontmatter — type, scope, verified, summary — one line per memory,
# newest first: the lines are pointers, and the fact itself is read from its
# file when it matters. What belongs in the store, and the file format, is
# docs/mds/story-workflow/writing-workflow-conventions.md section 10.
#
# `--list` prints that index as plain text and reads no payload: the form a
# person, a test, or the consistency check calls by hand.
#
# Why UserPromptSubmit and not SessionStart: in Kimi, SessionStart is
# observation-only (fire-and-forget) and cannot inject context. UserPromptSubmit
# is the only context-injecting event — on exit 0 its stdout is appended to
# context. We fire once per session by keying a marker file on the payload's
# session_id, so it does not repeat every turn.
#
# Registration: Kimi does not auto-load project config, so add the [[hooks]]
# block from .kimi-code/hooks.example.toml to your global config at
# $KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml (default ~/.kimi-code/config.toml), or run
# .kimi-code/hooks/install.sh once, which registers all three STORY hooks for you.
