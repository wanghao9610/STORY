# STORY UserPromptSubmit hook (Kimi Code) — inject the session's model id into
# context once per session so skills record a real model_id instead of
# "unrecorded".
#
# Why UserPromptSubmit and not SessionStart: in Kimi, SessionStart is
# observation-only (fire-and-forget) and cannot inject context, and its payload
# carries no model id. UserPromptSubmit is the only context-injecting event —
# on exit 0 its stdout is appended to context. We fire once per session by
# keying a marker file on the payload's session_id, so it does not repeat every
# turn.
#
# Kimi does not expose the active model to hooks, so we read `default_model`
# from config.toml — the CONFIGURED default, which can differ from the active
# model if it was overridden with `kimi -m` or `/model`. Self-reported per
# workflow provenance rule, so a mid-session switch can leave a stale
# value.
#
# Registration: Kimi does not auto-load project config, so this hook cannot be
# committed live the way the other harnesses' are. Add the [[hooks]] block from
# .kimi-code/hooks.example.toml to your global config at
# $KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml (default ~/.kimi-code/config.toml) to enable it.
# It registers a relative command path, which resolves per-project because Kimi
# runs hooks with the working directory set to the project root.
