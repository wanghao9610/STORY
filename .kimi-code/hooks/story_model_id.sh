# STORY UserPromptSubmit hook (Kimi Code) — inject the session's model id into
# context once per session so skills record a real model_id instead of
# "unrecorded".
#
# Why UserPromptSubmit and not SessionStart: in Kimi, SessionStart is
# observation-only (fire-and-forget) and cannot inject context. UserPromptSubmit
# is the only context-injecting event — on exit 0 its stdout is appended to
# context. We fire once per session by keying a marker file on the payload's
# session_id, so it does not repeat every turn.
#
# The id stated here is `default_model` from config.toml — the CONFIGURED
# default, which can differ from the active model if it was overridden with
# `kimi -m` or `/model`. The skill copies it verbatim per the workflow
# provenance rule (conventions section 7), so a mid-session switch can leave a
# stale value.
#
# Registration: Kimi does not auto-load project config, so this hook cannot be
# committed live the way the other harnesses' are. Add the [[hooks]] block from
# .kimi-code/hooks.example.toml to your global config at
# $KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml (default ~/.kimi-code/config.toml) to enable it.
# It registers a relative command path, which resolves per-project because Kimi
# runs hooks with the working directory set to the project root.
