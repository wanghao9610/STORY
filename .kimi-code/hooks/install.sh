# Register STORY's Kimi hooks in Kimi's GLOBAL config; running it again changes nothing.
#
# Three hooks: model_id provenance, the project-memory index injected from
# .story/memory/, and the commit guard that declines the git commands the writing
# STORY git safety policy blocks. The first two inject context on
# UserPromptSubmit; the guard decides instead, so it registers on PreToolUse
# matching Bash.
#
# Kimi has no project-level hook config, so the [[hooks]] entries must live in
# the global config at $KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml (default ~/.kimi-code/config.toml).
# This is one-time-per-machine setup: because the command paths are relative and
# Kimi runs hooks from the project root, those entries then cover every STORY
# dissertation repository with no per-project editing.
#
# Safe to re-run: each hook is registered only when it is not there already, so a
# machine set up before the commit guard existed gains just that one. It backs
# the config up before its first modification, and appends new [[hooks]] table
# arrays (valid TOML) rather than rewriting anything.
