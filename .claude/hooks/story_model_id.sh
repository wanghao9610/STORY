# STORY SessionStart hook — inject the runtime-reported model id into session
# context so skills record a real model_id instead of "unrecorded".
#
# Claude Code puts a `model` field on the SessionStart payload, and nowhere else:
# no other hook event carries it, and there is no $CLAUDE_MODEL env var. It is
# absent whenever the session did not start fresh — after /clear, resume,
# compact, or fork — which in practice is most sessions. And when it is present
# it is a snapshot of one moment: /model switches the model without any hook
# firing, so a session that starts on one model and writes with another would
# record the one it started on.
#
# Both holes have the same floor. Claude Code stamps `message.model` on every
# assistant turn it appends to the session transcript, and the payload always
# carries `transcript_path`. That transcript is empty at SessionStart, so the
# read cannot happen here; instead the injected line hands the skill the command
# to run at the moment it needs the value, which is also the moment the answer is
# true. The SessionStart field is passed along to that command, because it is the
# more precise of the two when they agree: it may carry a context-window suffix
# the transcript drops (claude-opus-5[1m] -> claude-opus-5).
#
# Registered under hooks.SessionStart in .claude/settings.json. Prints one JSON
# object whose additionalContext is added to context before the first prompt.

# --resolve <transcript_path> [session_model]: print the model id of the last
# main-loop assistant turn in a transcript, or nothing at all. Run on demand by
# skills, per the line injected below. Prints nothing rather than failing, so
# "unrecorded" stays the fallback.
#
# Sidechain turns are skipped: a delegated subagent may run a different model,
# and the question this answers is which model is writing the artifact.
#
# session_model is what SessionStart reported, and settles the two ways the
# transcript alone is not enough. It stands in when the transcript names nothing
# yet, and it is preferred over an identical id to keep a context-window suffix
# the transcript drops. It never wins over a different id — that difference is a
# mid-session switch, and the transcript is the one that saw it.
