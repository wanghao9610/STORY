# STORY SessionStart hook (Qwen Code) — inject the project's memory index into session
# context so a session starts knowing what earlier sessions in this repository
# learned.
#
# The store is .story/memory/ in the project, not the harness's own memory: one
# file per fact, listed one line each in MEMORY.md, with machine-specific facts
# under local/ (git-ignored, like .env). Only the index is injected — the lines
# are pointers, and the fact itself is read from its file when it matters. What
# belongs in the store, and the format of both, is
# docs/mds/story-workflow/memory_spec.md.
#
# Nothing is printed when the store holds no entries, so a fresh dissertation pays
# nothing: the rule that creates the first memory is AGENTS.md section 8, which
# is loaded anyway.
#
# Registered under SessionStart in .qwen/settings.json. Prints one JSON
# object whose additionalContext is added to context before the first prompt.

# The payload is not read, but it is consumed: the runtime writes it to this
# hook's stdin and a hook that never reads leaves that write to fail.

# An `env` memory is a fact about a machine, and machines change under it; six

# macOS and GNU's on Linux; where neither works, nothing is marked at all.

ctx="STORY project memory — what earlier sessions in this repository learned, recorded under .story/memory/ rather than in your own memory store. Each line is a pointer, not the fact: type · scope · last verified · file — summary. Open the file under .story/memory/ before acting on one. A scope naming a machine or a milestone applies only there, and where a memory disagrees with a file in the repository, the file wins. A memory is never a source for a number, an institutional rule, or what a cited paper says — those trace to mates/, degree/ and milestones/, and notes/refs/. Recording a new one: AGENTS.md section 8."
