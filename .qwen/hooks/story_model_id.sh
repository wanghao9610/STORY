# STORY SessionStart hook (Qwen Code) — inject the runtime-reported model id into
# session context so skills record a real model_id instead of "unrecorded".
#
# Qwen Code puts a `model` field on the SessionStart payload for every start
# reason it reports — startup, resume, clear and compact alike — so unlike Claude
# Code's copy of this hook there is no start shape that arrives without one. What
# it cannot cover is the same hole everywhere: /model switches the model without
# firing any hook, so a session that starts on one model and writes with another
# would record the one it started on.
#
# The floor under that is the session transcript. Qwen Code appends one record
# per model response to <project dir>/chats/<session_id>.jsonl, each carrying
# `type: "assistant"` and the `model` that wrote it, and the payload always names
# the file in `transcript_path`. The transcript is empty at SessionStart, so the
# read cannot happen here; instead the injected line hands the skill the command
# to run at the moment it needs the value, which is also the moment the answer is
# true. The SessionStart field is passed along to that command as the fallback
# for a transcript that has no assistant turn yet.
#
# Registered under hooks.SessionStart in .qwen/settings.json. Prints one JSON
# object whose additionalContext is added to context before the first prompt.

# --resolve <transcript_path> [session_model]: print the model id of the last
# assistant turn in a transcript, or nothing at all. Run on demand by skills, per
# the line injected below. Prints nothing rather than failing, so "unrecorded"
# stays the fallback.
#
# No sidechain filter is needed here, unlike Claude Code's copy: a Qwen subagent
# writes to its own transcript, named separately in the hook payload as
# `agent_transcript_path`, so this file holds main-loop turns only — which is the
# question this answers, namely which model is writing the artifact.
#
# session_model is what SessionStart reported. It stands in when the transcript
# names nothing yet, and never wins over an id the transcript does name — that
# difference is a mid-session switch, and the transcript is the one that saw it.
