# Single STORY-managed files an update overwrites alongside the trees above.
# execs/run.sh is here because the skills call it by name and by flag — a dissertation
# repo that syncs a skill using `run.sh --main` while keeping a run.sh that
# predates the flag gets a run that fails at its build step. The three utilities
# under execs/scpts/ are here for the same reason and it is not weaker: sixteen
# skills call `import.sh --diff` and five call `lint.sh --no-build` by name and
# by flag, `lint.sh` calls `fmt.sh --check` the same way, and a caller reading an
# exit code means the one its own version documents. No script here carries
# project configuration: everything an instance sets lives in .env, which is
# git-ignored and never synced (conventions §3.1) — so all five are safe to
# replace wholesale.
#
# execs/update.sh syncs itself, so a repo never strands on an update mechanism
# too old to fetch its successor. A running shell script must not be rewritten
# in place — bash reads it incrementally by offset, so a truncating extract can
# resume parsing into different bytes — so this one file is kept out of the tar
# below and installed by rename instead (SELF_PATH, further down): the running
# process keeps the old inode to the end, the next invocation gets the new file.

Usage: bash execs/update.sh [ref] [--skill NAME] [--force]
       bash execs/update.sh --diff [ref] [--skill NAME] [--force]
       bash execs/update.sh --adopt

Overwrite the STORY-managed content — the shared agent instructions (AGENTS.md
and the Cursor rule that copies its body), the four per-harness skill trees
(.claude/skills/, .agents/skills/, .cursor/skills/, .kimi-code/skills/), the
four session-hook trees that inject the project-memory index and the session's
model id, docs/mds/story-workflow/, and every script under execs/ — the two
entrypoints, run.sh and this one, and the three utilities in execs/scpts/:
import.sh, lint.sh, fmt.sh — with files from upstream.
The default ref is main; a branch or tag may be supplied instead. Local edits to
those paths are replaced, AGENTS.md included; the manuscript, evidence, notes,
and the memory store under .story/memory/ are never touched. Use --skill to
update only the named skill across all four skill trees (it leaves everything
else, entrypoints and docs included, alone).

No script under execs/ holds project configuration — everything an instance sets
lives in .env, which is git-ignored and never synced — so all five are safe to
replace. They are synced because they are called by name and by
flag: run.sh --main, lint.sh --no-build and import.sh --diff from the skills,
fmt.sh --check from lint.sh. A repo that syncs a skill while keeping a script
that predates the flag it passes gets a run that fails at that step. execs/update.sh syncs itself, so no repo strands on an
update mechanism too old to fetch its successor: it is installed by rename,
which leaves this running process on the old file and gives the next invocation
the new one.

Harness configuration an instance may have edited — .cursorignore and the three
hook registrations (.claude/settings.json, .codex/hooks.json, .cursor/hooks.json)
— is installed when it is absent and otherwise kept, however far it has drifted
from upstream; only --force overwrites it. A kept registration that does not name
a hook is reported, since a hook nobody registers never fires.

--diff previews an update without changing anything: it lists upstream files
that are new or differ from the local copies, harness configuration that
differs but would be kept, and project-local files an update would keep. It
exits 0 when everything already matches, 2 when an update would change files,
and 1 on error — so a script can tell "an update is available" from "the check
itself failed".

--force updates the same paths with both refusals lifted: uncommitted changes
under them are overwritten instead of stopping the command, and the harness
configuration above is overwritten instead of kept. It widens nothing — the
path list is unchanged, and a file upstream does not have is still left alone.
Combined with --diff it previews that scope without changing anything.

--adopt installs the STORY skeleton into an already-started dissertation repo instead
of updating this one. It runs against the current working directory, which
must be a git repository root, and never overwrites a file that is already
there: every existing path is kept and reported. Run `story-proj-adopt` in
your agent afterwards to wire the dissertation up.
