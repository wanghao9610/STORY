# byte for byte; a reformat that does not is a tool bug, and the manuscript is
# left as it was rather than rebuilt to find out.

#   1  --check: at least one file would be reformatted
#   2  at least one file was refused — the rewrite would have altered the text
#   3  cannot run: no latexindent, no config, or a path this script may not touch

Usage: bash execs/scpts/fmt.sh [--check] [PATH ...]

Reformat the manuscript's LaTeX to one sentence per line — latexindent's
oneSentencePerLine, configured by .latexindent.yaml at the repository root.

With no PATH, the manuscript's own sources: manus/main.tex, manus/fronts/,
manus/chaps/, manus/backs/, and manus/tabs/. A PATH may be a file or a
directory; directories are searched for *.tex.

Two trees are never formatted, named or not: manus/stys/ and an official
institutional template under milestones/*/template/. Those are reusable or
externally supplied files, and reformatting one is editing the template.

Every rewrite is checked before it is kept. LaTeX collapses each whitespace run
to a single space, so a reformat that only moves line breaks leaves the typeset
text identical; the file is compared before and after under exactly that
normalization, and a file that fails is reported and left untouched. It needs a
hand fix — usually a sentence latexindent misread, such as a lowercase
abbreviation ("std.", "et al.") that ends a line and is better written with a
tie or an escaped space.

Options:
  --check       Report what would change; write nothing. Exit 1 on drift.
  -h, --help    Show this help message.

No build is run: formatting cannot move a page, a reference, or a todo count.
