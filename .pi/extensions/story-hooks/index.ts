// STORY session hooks for Pi.
//
// Pi's extension point is TypeScript, not a command-hook table, so this file
// plays the part .claude/settings.json, .codex/hooks.json, .cursor/hooks.json and
// .qwen/settings.json play in the other trees: it is the registration, and the
// three scripts beside this file are the logic, one copy per tree as everywhere
// else. They sit here rather than in .pi/hooks/ because Pi reserves that name for
// the old extensions directory and warns whenever it exists. Pi discovers
// .pi/extensions/*/index.ts by itself once the project is trusted, so there is
// nothing to register by hand and nothing to merge after an update.
//
// What it wires:
//   - model-id provenance and the project-memory index, injected as one message
//     before the first agent run, and again whenever the model changes
//   - the commit guard, on the bash tool, declining what the STORY git safety
//     policy forbids
//
// What it deliberately does not wire: the involve gate. That hook exists to
// answer the permission prompt before a file edit while .env reads INVOLVE=low,
// and Pi ships no permission prompts — there is no prompt to skip, so the level
// governs only what the skills themselves ask.
