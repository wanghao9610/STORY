# STORY session hook (Pi) — print the project's memory index so a session starts
# knowing what earlier sessions in this repository learned.
#
# The store is .story/memory/ in the project, not the harness's own memory: one
# file per fact, with a git-ignored local/ beside it (like .env) holding what
# stays on this machine: the machine: scoped facts, and any memory the author
# keeps off the repository. What is printed is an index built here from each
# file's frontmatter — type, scope, verified, summary — one line per memory,
# newest first: the lines are pointers, and the fact itself is read from its
# file when it matters. What belongs in the store, and the file format, is
# docs/mds/story-workflow/writing-workflow-conventions.md section 10.
#
# `--list` prints that index as plain text and reads no payload: the form a
# person, a test, or the consistency check calls by hand.
#
# Nothing is printed when the store holds no entries, so a fresh thesis pays
# nothing: the rule that creates the first memory is AGENTS.md section 8, which
# is loaded anyway.
#
# Pi has no command-hook protocol — its extension point is TypeScript — so this
# copy takes no payload and prints the context as plain text. Wrapping it into a
# message the model sees is .pi/extensions/story-hooks/index.ts's job, which is
# also why there is no JSON encoder here: a tree whose runtime reads stdout as
# JSON encodes, and Pi's reads it as text.

# Every harness registers this script by its own path inside the project, so the
# project root is derived from the script itself — no environment variable and no
# payload field, which differ per harness. Three levels here, not the other trees'
# two: Pi reserves .pi/hooks/ as the old name for extensions and warns when it
# exists, so these scripts live beside the extension that runs them, one directory
# deeper (.pi/extensions/story-hooks/).
