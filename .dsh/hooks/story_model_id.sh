# STORY SessionStart hook (DeepSeek Harness) — inject the runtime-reported model
# id into session context so skills record a real model_id instead of "unrecorded".
#
# DSH has no hook table of its own; it runs STORY's hooks through its Claude Code
# bridge, and that bridge's SessionStart payload carries session_id, cwd and
# transcript_path but no `model` — DSH's own bridge README lists `model` among
# the fields it omits. Nor is there one in the environment: the managed DSH_*
# variables reach the model's own shell calls, not a hook process. So nothing at
# session start can state the model, and the value has to be read where DSH
# writes it.
#
# DSH does write it. Every session log carries a `request/context` record with
# the resolved provider and model, appended whenever the route changes, so the
# last one is the model in force; `request/header` carries the same pair inside
# its call config, as a second place to look. The payload's transcript_path
# names that log. It is empty at SessionStart, so the read cannot happen here;
# instead the injected line hands the skill the command to run at the moment it
# needs the value, which is also the moment the answer is true. That is the same
# shape the Claude Code copy uses, for the same reason, over a different log.
#
# Registered under hooks.SessionStart in .dsh/hooks.json. Prints one JSON object
# whose additionalContext is added to context before the first prompt — the
# bridge consumes that field and ignores plain stdout, so prose would run,
# succeed, and inject nothing.

# --resolve [transcript_path]: print `provider/model` for the last route the
# session log records, or nothing at all. Run on demand by skills, per the line
# injected below. With no argument it falls back to $DSH_SESSION_JSONL, which
# DSH puts in the environment of every model shell call — that is what answers
# after a compaction has taken the injected line away. Prints nothing rather
# than failing, so "unrecorded" stays the fallback.
