# Register STORY's DSH hooks in DeepSeek Harness's GLOBAL composition; running it again changes nothing.
#
# Three hooks: model_id provenance, the project-memory index injected from
# .story/memory/, and the commit guard that declines the git commands the workflow
# conventions §1 forbid. The first two inject context on SessionStart; the guard
# decides instead, so it registers on PreToolUse matching DSH's `bash` tool.
#
# DSH reads no plugin configuration out of a project, so the row that loads the
# hook bridge has to live in the machine's own $DSH_HOME/cordis.patch.yml
# (default ~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml), which every profile applies. This is
# one-time-per-machine setup: the bridge's configPath is relative and resolves
# against the directory dsh was launched in, so that one row then covers every
# STORY project with no per-project editing, and a project without .dsh/hooks.json
# registers nothing.
#
# Safe to re-run: the row is added only when it is not there already, the file is
# backed up before its first modification, and the row is appended as a new patch
# operation rather than rewriting anything.
#
# It installs no packages. The bridge is not a dsh dependency, so this script
# reports which of your profiles still need it and prints the command; running
# pnpm inside your profiles is yours to approve, not a side effect of this.
